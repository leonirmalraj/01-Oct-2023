Introduction:
HTTP, the backbone of the web, has evolved significantly. This blog explores the differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

HTTP/1.1:

- Standardized in 1997.
- Inefficient headers, causing latency.
- Head-of-line blocking slows page loading.
- Resource bundling leads to wasteful downloads.

HTTP/2:

- Standardized in 2015.
- Multiplexing enables concurrent requests.
- Header compression reduces overhead.
- Server push eliminates unnecessary requests.
- Binary framing for efficient processing.
- Resource prioritization for improved user experience.

Choosing Between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2:

- Consider browser and server support.
- Optimize your website for HTTP/2.
- Ensure HTTPS for HTTP/2.
- Support legacy systems if necessary.

Conclusion:
HTTP/2 offers superior performance, but the choice depends on your audience, server, and optimization efforts. Understanding these differences is key to a faster web experience.
