Introduction:
JavaScript objects are vital data structures used for organizing and storing data.
 In this blog, we'll explore the internal representation of objects and key concepts.

What's an Object?
JavaScript objects are collections of key-value pairs, used to structure and manage data.

Object Properties:

- Data Properties: Store values.
- Accessor Properties: Use getter and setter functions.
- Methods: Functions as properties.

Internal Representation:

- Object Map: Maps keys to values.
- Hidden Classes: Optimize property access.
- Property Descriptors: Define property behavior.
- Prototype Chain: Look up properties in prototypes.

Object Creation:

- Literal Notation
- Constructor Functions
- Object.create()
- Class Syntax (ES6)

Object Prototypes:

Prototypes provide property fallbacks.

Conclusion:

Understanding JavaScript objects, their internal workings, and prototypes is essential for efficient and powerful code development.
